# BrokenPaths

My submission for the GitHub Game Off gamejam 2024, where the theme was "Secrets". I used this gamejam to learn animation blueprints with Unreal and advanced AI setups, following a set of YouTube tutorials. It includes my setup for the full body awareness, weapon and camera switching + combat AI setup, based on Lyras AI code. Content used: Lyras animations and models. Various Epic free models. Various free models from Sketchfab. UnrealEngine version: 5.4. Download size: 2GB
