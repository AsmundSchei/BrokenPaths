# BrokenPaths

My submission for the GitHub Game Off gamejam 2024, where the theme was "Secrets". I used this gamejam to learn animation blueprints with Unreal and advanced AI setups, following a set of YouTube tutorials. This repo contains only free Unreal content such as Lyras animations and models. It include my setup for the full body awareness, weapon and camera switching. Enemy AI may be incomplete, as I havent studied Lyras AI yet. Heres a preview of the animation system https://x.com/AsmundSchei/status/1855678479309623457
